                        <p>I am a graduate from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a> with a Dual Degree (Bachelors &amp; Masters) in Computer Science &amp; Engineering and a Micro Specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I like to apply my technical skills, accrued from my engineering studies, to conflate the spheres of technology and innovation. I am passionate about applying AI to new domains and developing products that have a meaningful impact on people's lives.</p>
                        <p>Whether it is academics or management, challenging real-life problem-solving always attracts me. In the quest for expanding my horizons, I have constantly aimed at pursuing diverse interests. I'm a team player and love to work in collaboration. I also believe in helping the community and like to be a leader.</p>
                        <p>When not coding, you will most often find me making EDM or supporting Manchester United. GGMU :)</p>
